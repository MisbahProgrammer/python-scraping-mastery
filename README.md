# 🎓 Road to ITMO: Zero to Backend Engineer 🚀

Welcome to my personal coding repository! This project documents my intensive preparation for my Bachelor's degree in **02.03.03 Mathematical Foundations and Administration of Information Systems** at ITMO University, St. Petersburg.

As a **Winner of the Open Doors Scholarship 2025 (Applied Mathematics & AI Track)**, I built this curriculum to bridge the gap between basic programming and university-level backend engineering.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am **Misbah Ur Rehman**, an incoming ITMO student and the creator behind the [Bit Fix YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Bit-Fix-1), where I help students worldwide navigate international scholarships and study abroad opportunities.

**My Future Plan:**
Upon completing my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematical Foundations and Administration of Information Systems at ITMO, I intend to enter the industry as a Backend or AI Engineer to apply my skills in real-world, high-load systems. My goal is to gain hands-on experience in deploying scalable software architectures and machine learning models, bridging the gap between theoretical algorithms and practical application. After establishing a strong professional foundation, I plan to return to academia to pursue a Master’s degree, specifically focusing on advanced artificial intelligence or distributed systems. Ultimately, I aim to become a lead solutions architect, driving innovation in the field of automated data processing.

## 🗺️ The Bootcamp Curriculum (Days 1 to 6)
This repository contains my daily code commits, moving from Python basics to automated data extraction.

| Day | Topic | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Day 1** | Python Fundamentals | Variables, Data Types, and basic I/O operations. | ✅ |
| **Day 2** | Control Flow & Logic | `if/else` statements, `for` and `while` loops. | ✅ |
| **Day 3** | Data Structures | Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples for data management. | ✅ |
| **Day 4** | File Handling (TXT) | Reading from and writing to local text files securely. | ✅ |
| **Day 5** | Data Processing (CSV) | Structuring data into Excel-ready `.csv` formats using the `csv` module. | ✅ |
| **Day 6** | Web Scraping | Extracting live HTML data using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4`. | ✅ |

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (Day 7 and Beyond)
To prepare for the rigorous System Administration and Programming modules at ITMO, the next phases of this repository will cover:
* **Day 7:** API Integration (Fetching JSON data).
* **Day 8-10:** SQL & Databases (PostgreSQL basics).
* **Day 11+:** Linux Command Line and OS Basics.
* **Day 15+:** Introduction to Go (Golang) and High-Load Architecture.
